        <h1>üëãüèº Hello! I'm Julio Cesar,</h1>
        <p>
            <h3><b>a software and UI/UX developer with 2+ years of experience, a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of California, Merced, and an additional 5+ years of CAD and engineering experience. </b> </h3>I've built software tools together with small businesses and big government organizations. Many of the initiatives on which I have worked, from conception to deployment, have involved the development of new ideas. I've created a variety of software tools, including an eye-controlled e-book reader, a native location-based iOS iPhone app, and web applications for organizations like (BART) Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm building a food delivery web application with family-owned businesses in the Los Angeles area to take back control of their online presence from applications like DoorDash and Uber Eats. Upon completion of the project, commission fees from these applications will be eliminated, increasing revenue by up to 40%. Beyond this, I stay busy developing different websites and applications for businesses throughout Southern California as a full-stack developer with tools like Flask. Lately, I've been expanding my 3D development and frontend skills by working with javascript libraries such as three.js and react.js.
        </p>
